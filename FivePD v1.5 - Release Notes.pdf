FivePD v1.5 - Release Notes
Released on July 24, 2021
Table of contents
IMPORTANT - OneSync Compatibility Notice
In previous versions of the gamemode, FivePD was not considerd OneSync
compatible. Recently, modifications were made to allow basic interoperability
between FivePD and OneSync. Now, thanks to many improvements and
changes in v1.5, we are happy to say that FivePD now offically recommends
OneSync be enabled and used for syncing. Ped, vehicle, and service spawning
have all been reworked to better support compatibility.
Please note that some features may be disabled if you have OneSync turned
off.
